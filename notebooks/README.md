The download_descriptions.ipynb was an attempt to download descriptions for a greater number of movies compared to the original code. This is because in the orig. code, the page number cannot be greater than 500. Hence, a list of movie ids was gathered. Then the descriptions were downloaded for all these movies. The movie_ids.tar.gz contains the movie_ids.json file. It is impractical to have these many movie descriptions.
